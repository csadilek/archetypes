/**
 * A marshallable bean that carries the response event from the server back to

 * This is a {@code @Conversational} bean, so if it is fired as a CDI event from
 * within an observer method, it will only be delivered to the client who originated
 * the first event. Without the {@code @Conversational} annotation, this event would
 * be broadcast to every client every time it was fired. See the

 * conversational events</a> section of the Errai Reference Guide for details.
